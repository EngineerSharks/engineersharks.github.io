                    We did research on our prototype to find one that met our design constraints (time, information,
                    skills, cost, tools, and manpower).  We each made our own design for the prototype, listed here:

                                A divide recycling box that has, on each of the recycled material, a guide to what
                                can be recycled and how to recycle the objects, such as not having metal bottle baps
                                on plastic bottles and not having leftover food in containers.

                                Having instructions on how to recycle items into the recycling bin so that
                                people know how to recycle the item properly.

                                Having several recycling bins that separate recyclable materials
                                to reduce ambiguity.

                        <u>Usability</u> is how easy the prototype is to use (such as setting up the device, installing, and using).
                        We ranked this a two because any ideas we come up with will have high usability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Understandability</u> is how easy it is to understand the prototype.  We ranked this highest (five)
                        because our main focus is to help people understand recycling better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Compactness</u> measures how compact the device is.  This is important because some recycling bins
                        may be limited in space where something can be added on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Convenience</u> shows how convenient the device will be.  This is ranked second-highest because
                        we do not want these devices to be a nuisance to the person recycling, the recycling bin owner,
                        or whoever empties the recycling bin.

                    A plastic board that has a slot for a printed paper which can be inserted for instructions on which
                    recyclable material (such as cardboard, plastic, paper, etc.) goes in which bin.  This board
                    will also have instructions on how to properly recycle items, and will be attached to the top
                    of the recycling bin.

                    Visualizations help us understand the prototype better.  The first visualization is a drawing made
                    in Paint which shows a very basic idea of the prototype, as shown below:
                </p>
                <img src="prototype_drawing_a.png" alt="first drawing">
                <p>
                    The green portion with the word "glass" is the paper that will be inserted into the slot.  The
                    outline below the paper is the slot that the paper will be inserted into.  The rest of the design
                    is the recycling bin.  Of course, this is a very basic design, and was made during the design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then made a second prototype drawing, shown below:

                <p>
                    The two bins are the recycling bins.  The white portion is the paper that will be inserted into the
                    slot, as shown above the bins.  The "instructions" will have details on if the materials need to be
                    washed, cleaned, or have any other instructions before being recycled.

                    We tested our prototype design against our design constraints.  The resources used in this prototype was
                    some leftover cardboard, a piece of paper, scissors, tape, and part of a plastic bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this prototype, you can slot the paper in to indicate what types of recycling are allowed in the
                    bin, and can easily be entered in either by hand or through a printed out paper.

                    Unfortunately, we did not have a great recycling bin to test our prototype on; however, this would work
                    as an add-on for nearly any type of recycling bin used in schools and companies, as the footprint of
                    these environments is much heavier than individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This prototype met all of our requirements and did not break any constraints.  While this prototype is
                    made out of cardboard and cheap plastic, a real prototype would be made of higher quality materials
                    while still not breaking our constraints.
