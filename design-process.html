                    We wanted a way to make recycling easier for people while still balancing simplicity
                    and affordability for recycling bin owners.  Our design process encompasses all three of these ideas,
                    making our design a great solution for people who recycle and people who manage recycling bins.

                    We have several constraints for our project that we must follow to keep the design as
                    simple and affordable as possible.  These constraints are:

                    <li>
                        <b>Information</b>: We are able to use the Internet, library resources, and our general knowledge.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Cost</b>: There will be no cost associated with this project.

                    Our solution must meet the following requirements to keep it as simple and affordable as possible:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Compact</b>: The solution must be compact for easy storage.  The dimensions of the solution must be
                        12 inches tall by 9.5 inches wide by one inch thick.  This is so the solution can be made as a
                        sort of "add-on" to existing recycling bins.

                                To test, we will make a prototype made of cardboard and plastic to represent what the
                                final product will look like.  We will then measure the dimensions of the prototype to
                                ensure that it meets the requirements.

                                To test this, we will make a QR code which links to our website that has the instructions.
                                This will reduce the waste of paper and make the instructions easier to access.  We will
                                also include a link to the instructions for people who do not have a QR code scanner.

                        such as cleaning wipes).  When dealing with items near food waste bins, the prototype is bound
                        to get dirty, and having a solution that is easy to clean is important.

                    In our research, we discovered that only 20 to 30 percent of waste in the United States is recycled,
                    and up to 75% of waste can be recycled.  If we are able to reach this 75%, it would be the equivalent of
                    taking fifty-five MILLION cars off of the street, along with creating over a million new jobs.  By recycling, we can
                    conserve the finite amount of resources left on the planet.

                    The basics of recycling are to recycle bottles (such as plastic bottles with their caps on, or
                    glass bottles which are fully intact).  Non-crushed cans, paper, and cardboard can be recycled
                    as well.  While this is not very well known, cardboard with grease on it can be recycled as well.
