                When looking into the problems plaguing today's world, our team decided to focus on recycling for our project.
                In recent years, recycling has become commonplace; however, we noticed that the biggest concern people face when
                recycling is what to recycle and how to recycle properly.

                    "Many recyclables become contaminated when items are placed in the wrong bin,
                    or when a dirty food container gets into the recycling bin.  Contaminations can prevent large
                    batches of materials from being recycled.  Other materials can't be processed in certain facilities."

                        Recycling in the U.S. Is Broken. How Do We Fix It?

                We decided to look into a fix for this because we understand the importance of recycling and
                its many benefits for both people and the environment.  We hope our design will make it easier
                and more feasible for household across the United States to recycle their waste properly.

                    In recent years, recycling has become more commonplace.  Because of this, people all around
                    the world do not know how to recycle properly.  This leads to recyclable materials not being
                    recycled, and instead being thrown away.
                    <br><br>
                    To fix this, we will prototype with more specific recycling bins specific for certain types
                    of recyclables.  These types of recyclables include glass, paper, aluminum, and more, which
                    will help reduce ambiguity between choosing either a trash or recycle bin.

                    For our design process, we wanted a way to make recycling easier for people while still balancing simplicity
                    and affordability for recycling bin owners.  Our design process encompasses all three of these ideas,
                    making our design a great solution for people who recycle and people who manage recycling bins.

                    Our prototype is designed to be an "add-on" of sorts to existing recycling bins.  This allows for
                    the recycling bins to be used as they are currently, but with the added benefit of having more
                    specific bins for different types of recyclables.
